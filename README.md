### I'm Gabriel.
A 20 year old 2nd-year undergraduate university student from Greece, studying [**Computer Science** at the **University of Crete**](https://csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en).
My first interaction with computers was when I was 4 years old and that's how the object became a mainstream part of my life, especially hardware and software wise.
Currently learning C++ and Java (at object-oriented level). During high school I also learnt Python & other web-oriented languages, such as HTML, CSS & PHP.
